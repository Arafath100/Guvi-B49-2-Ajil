1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:

    HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer     Protocol.It is used for client(request) to server(response).
                                  |            |
                          data/information   Set of 
                              passing         rules
 
    * HTTP1.1 can only reuse (Use the  limited information at the same time) but HTTP2 can use to concurrent(Use the many information at the same time).

    * HTTP2 much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1.



2.Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

    * In Javascript, objects are the object ,with properties and type.

    * For ex:A book is a object ,with properties and type.A book has a name,color,a material it is made of, etc...
      A same way,javascript objects have a properties and type which define their characteristics.

    * And objects also have a method.
 
    * All JavaScript values are objects.Except javaScript primitives.In javascript a primitive value is a value.
